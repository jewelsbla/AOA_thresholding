## Content

CT scans of glass fiber reinforced polymers are used to determine the fiber volume content (FVC) through image processing. However, in the case of carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP), the contrast between the polymer matrix existing of C-atoms and the carbon fibers existing of C-atoms is very low. Additionally, as carbon fibers have a small diameter of 5-7 Âµm, the resolution has to be high in order to resolve the fibers. Both effects lead to noisy images. As the histograms of low contrast CT images do not show two peaks for the two materials but rather one single distribution, simple thresholding does not lead to good segmentation results (determined FVC had been compared to experimental values). Hence, a sample thickness-based adjustment of the Otsu threshold, the so-called "above or average (AOA) thresholding" has been implemented in this code. It is based on an empirical approach of a binary decision between the single slice Otsu threshold and the average stack Otsu threshold. Please consider the above-mentioned paper for more details.
